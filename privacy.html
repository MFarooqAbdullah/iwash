						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">We are strongly committed to letting you know how we will collect and use your personal information. The policies below are applicable to Fama Technologies, Inc.’s network of platforms and services, including <a href="http://web.fama.io" class="color-green">web.fama.io</a>, and all apps published by Fama (“Platforms”).</p>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered online at our Platforms. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to Sites, as defined below, or by Sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us.</p>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at privacy@fama.io.</p>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Fama Technologies, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  Fama Technologies, Inc has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" class="color-green link-fonts">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">The two sections below (<b class="fw-1000">Fama for Businesses</b> and <b class="fw-1000">Fama for Individuals</b>) offer an overview of our platform privacy policies. While many websites simply include a privacy policy governing access to their marketing websites, we thought to include an additional layer of transparency about the information we collect when businesses enlist the use of our Platforms.</p>


						<h3 class="mb-30 color-black1">Fama For Businesses: FCRA and EEOC Compliance</h3>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2"><b class="fw-1000">FCRA</b>. Fama considers itself a consumer reporting agency when businesses pay Fama to use its services for decisions related to hiring or medical staffing, as such, Fama complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the United States. Fama offers the disclosure and authorization forms, relevant state-by-state disclosures, pre-adverse and adverse notification letters, and a variety of other, up-to-date FCRA materials and best practices to ensure that your business stays compliant with the evolving legal landscape. In addition, Fama offers individuals the opportunity to opt-out of having their online identity collected by Fama.</p>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2"><b class="fw-1000">Privacy Shield</b>. Fama commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.</p>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Additionally, Fama has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Fama shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
						
						
						<h3 class="mb-30 color-black1">Fama For Individuals: Data & Communication</h3>

						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1">Data Use</h4>
						<ul id="li-green">
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">First, you provide written consent to one of our Customers as applicable with international, federal, state, and city law regarding access to your personal information. Then Fama will securely process this data on behalf of our Customers to collect publicly available online content related to you.</p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">We use this data to help our Customers understand trust, compatibility, and safety as drawn from the publicly available, online record.</p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Fama ensures the highest technical safeguards against data vulnerability, safety, and overall access to information.</p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Fama is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and holds itself to the same standards as other companies that fall under the remit of the FTC. </p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Fama’s liability in cases of onward transfers of data to third parties varies depending upon the commercial agreement that Fama has with its business customers, but treats any Customer data as if it were its own and offers best in class data security and safeguards against potential misuse.</p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Individuals are offered the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration.</p></li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="mb-30 color-black1">Communication</h3>
						<p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">Transparency and communication are essential bedrocks of our Platforms. While all of the information we collect is public, and can be accessed via the same web protocols used on your internet-connected device, Fama wants you to know what is publicly available about you. You have the right, and we encourage you to:</p>
						<ul id="li-green">
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">View the publicly available information that is available about you online. Contact us at privacy@fama.io to see a copy of your Fama report, if it has been created on behalf of a Customer. We’ll get back to you within 24 hours.</p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">You can challenge the accuracy of a Fama report at any time by emailing us at privacy@fama.io.</p></li>
							<li><p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">You can opt out of our service by contacting us at privacy@fama.io, as long as you have not provided written consent to one of our clients so Fama may access this information on your behalf. Further, Fama will delete all of the data that we have collected about you at your written request pending those same criteria.</p></li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at privacy@fama.io.</p>

						<h3 class="mb-30 color-black1">Controller</h3>

						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Third-Party Agents</h4>

						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Emergency Situations</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Sites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Sites or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Sites or the public.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Use of Non-Personal Information</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">We may disclose or share Non-Personal Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we will disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Sites and who our users are so we can improve our Sites. We will also disclose Non-Personal Information to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Sites.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">We are concerned about ensuring the security of your Personal Information. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your device to our servers. Personal Information collected by our Sites are stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you. Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Your Obligations to Keep Your Access Rights Secure</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by a Website’s registration form (such information being the “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Fama has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Fama has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof). You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.</p>

						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">What Happens When I Link To or From Another Website?</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">These Sites may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of Fama or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Governing Law</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">These Sites may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of Fama or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Notice to Non-US Users</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by your country to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit personal information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Assignment</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites and services. We may also sell certain assets associated with the Sites. As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Changes to This Policy</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our Sites. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy. We will not, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of Personal Information we have previously collected from you without your express consent.</p>


						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">How Do I Opt-Out or Correct Information About Me</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from Fama. We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us by going into your profile settings and choosing the appropriate options. To opt-out, you can also send us a message at reports@fama.io.</p>

						<h4 class="mb-30 color-black1 fs-28 fw-300">Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
						<p class="mb-30 fs-18 lh-32 color-gray2">California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Fama who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of their personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to reports@fama.io.</p>
